"How to access files on terminal"
---

```{r}
When you open terminal, your window should look like this:
  the name elizabeth on terminal is my user, your's will obviously be your name or something different
```

```{r}
In order to get into a certain folder using terminal, specific commands need to be known first.
Here's a common list of commands we will use. I will explain what each of them do later on. 
- cd 
- ls
- cd ..
okay, let's try using them.
```

```{r}
The ls command prints out our main files 
```

```{r}
Let's say you messed up, and want to go back one step. We use the cd .. command.
```

```{r}
as you can see it takes us back
```


"Accessing GitHub homework files from terminal"
---

```{r}
In class you will create your own repo on GitHub. Cloning the homework files into your local computer
and then "pushing" the edited files back to GitHub. This will be done using terminal
```
```{r}
Step 1: where did you save the GitHub files to? 
  I cloned the files into the Documents folder
```
![](Desktop/step4.png)
```{r}
Step 2: We do the ls command to find all files under my username. this lists basic folders.
we want to access the Documents folder since that's were we cloned our GitHub files
to do this we do cd Documents/ if your folder is named documents you do cd documents/
after the command, you're already in the Documents folder.
But why the cd command? the cd command essentially tells terminal to go inside that certain folder
```

**Remember terminal is case sensitive and don't forget the slash!**
**whenever you want to enter into another file you do cd foldername/**
```{r}
Step 3: we do the ls command to print all files inside the Document folder on terminal. 
```
![](Desktop/term4.png)
```{r}3
Step 4: the homework folder I have cloned from GitHub is named a9-githubuser in order to go inside that folder we use the cd command 
```
![](Desktop/step5.png)
Ë†
```{r}
Step 5: type the ls command to print files inside the a9-githubuser folder
```
![](Desktop/step6.png)
```{r}
Step 6: you want to open the file on an editor in terminal first, we will use vim, but you can use any
editor you would like. the command is
vi README.md 
README.md is the file name
scroll to the end of the file and type :q! and press enter. This is a way to leave the editor.
to leave the terminal type exit and then safely close terminal
```
![](Desktop/step7.png)
![](Desktop/vi.png)
```{r}
Okay! so you have finished the homework, now to push the edited file to GitHub.
```
**Remeber to SAVE the edited file first before pushing to GitHub**
---
```{r}
Step 1: We want to go into the folder where our homework file would be 
cd Documents/a9-githubuser9 
your pathway may be different depending where you cloned the homework, but we are using the previous example
```
```{r}
Step 2: Check status of file by using git status -s
you should see something similar as the picture
```
![](Desktop/tiny.png)
```{r}
Step 3: Type git commit -m "type a comment of what you have done" README.md 
the name of the file I have edited in this case is named README.md
```
![](Desktop/second.png)
* you should get a message with the end saying the following which means you're doing great!*
```{r}
Step 4: type in git status 
the bottom should say "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```
```{r}
Step 5: git push
wait a couple seconds, the end of the paragraph should say something similar:
master -> master
```

```{r}
Once you log in to Github, it should say how long ago the commit & push was made, everytime you made a edit to the file and want to push to github, just repeat these steps!
```
